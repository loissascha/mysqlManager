# MysqlManager
MySQL Management Tool created with .NET Blazor. Uses Electron to run as desktop application.

This project aims to create a simple to use, powerful tool to access your mysql database(s). It'll support MS Windows, Mac and Linux based operating systems.

This project is still very early in development and therefore not recommended to be used as a final product. A lot of features are still incomplete or missing. To use this project it's currently required to build it yourself as new features get added very quick and there is no point yet in creating finished releases.
